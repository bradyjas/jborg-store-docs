# Store Documentation

The documentation contained within this GitHub Pages site will cover nearly all
of the work I've put into the demostration e-commerce website
[store.jasonbrady.org](https://store.jasonbrady.org).

## Infrastructure

All infrastructure is hosted on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
(AWS).

## CI/CD Pipeline

[GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/) is used
for the build and deployment piplines.
